To entertain me. Don't try using this for anything in production.

Imitating a plane scheduling system



todo:

- parse plane file
- estimate average time between destinations, i.e. A-C 30 minutes (max 110% min 20%), A-B 90 minutes (max 200% min 80%)
- display location of planes for any given time, i.e 1300: pl1 A, pl2 B, pl3 in transit A-C (40% there)

- parse people file
- given a plane set, report whther each person will be able to make their travel
- given a people file, report what plane sets are needed (part 2: include times)

- estimate whether planes are full
- inject delays into the system and prompt rebooking
